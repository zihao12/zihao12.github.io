Hello there! I'm currently studying for my Ph.D. in Statistics at UChicago. I'm lucky to learn from [Prof. Victor Veitch](http://victorveitch.com/) and [Prof. Matthew Stephens](https://stat.uchicago.edu/people/profile/matthew-stephens/). Right now, I'm also a student researcher at Google Deepmind, under the mentorship of  [Prof. Sanmi Koyejo](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/sanmi/). 

I am currently interested about large language models, text-to-vision models and foundation models in general. 

Before graduate school, I completed my undergrad study in Computational and Applied Mathematics, also from UChicago. I spent two years at Wuhan University studying mathematics before transfering to Chicago.
