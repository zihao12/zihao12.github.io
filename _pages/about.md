I am a Ph.D. student at UChicago Statistics. I am advised by [Prof. Victor Veitch](http://victorveitch.com/) and [Professor Matthew Stephens](https://stat.uchicago.edu/people/profile/matthew-stephens/). My research interests include: concept control for foundation models, causal ML, domain generalization, unsupervised learning and Bayesian modeling.

Before graduate school, I completed my undergrad study in Computational and Applied Mathematics, also from UChicago. I spent two years at Wuhan University studying mathematics before transfering to Chicago.
