This paper concerns the structure of learned representations in text-guided generative models, focusing on score-based models. Here, we focus on the idea that concepts are encoded as subspaces (or directions) of some representation space.  We develop a mathematical formalization of this idea.Using this formalism, we show there's a natural choice of representation with this property, and we develop a simple method for identifying the part of the representation corresponding to a given concept. In particular, this allows us to manipulate the concepts expressed by the model through algebraic manipulation of the representation. We demonstrate the idea with examples text-guided image generation, using Stable Diffusion.
